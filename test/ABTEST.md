A/B Test Name: Writing or drop down

User Story Number: 2

Metric (from the HEART grid): Happiness

Hypothesis:
As a Product manager the Users will get two versions of the app where version A, the users will like choosing the ingredients with a drop down menu better than 
writing it, because it is cleaner than writing it down.

As a project manager I can track this information by seeing what version the user has with similar inputs in the app.  
For example if two users both put in ingredients for hamburgers, the drop down menu would have a longer app usage. 
We will have to track what version of the app certain people have and the amount of time the user was on the app for.



Experiment -  As the product manager I will have 50% of the users have version A while the other half will have version B.  The user will be able to rate how they feel about the change in version A.  We will need to set up the rating system, how long they use the app, and traffic to the last recipe page.


Variations - In Version A would be the normal app where the user would type in the ingredients.  And in Version B would be where the user finds the ingredients on a drop down menu.

A/B Test Name: Desired Cooking Time Feature
User Story Number: 2
Metric (from the HEART grid): Happiness and Engagement
Hypothesis:
As a product manager, the users will be able to input the amount of time I have to cook instead of their gender so they can get a recipe suitable for the time they have to cook , increasing engagement and satisfaction.

Experiment - For this experiment we can use the screen time and event monitoring to see how effective this feature is. If recipe saving and search events increase this is a sign that the new feature is increasing satisfaction and engagement. Also, if time change events occur frequently, this shows that the new feature is being used. The tracking that would need to be set up for this would be setting recipe saves, recipe searches, and desired time changes as events that are logged in Firebase Analytics. Finally, it is reasonable to test this experiment with 50% of the users to get an accurate representation of the variations performance versus the control performance.


Variations - In Version A would be the normal app where the user would type in their gender. And in Version B the gender input option would be replaced with a desired cooking time option where the user can type in the amount of minutes they would like to cook for.
