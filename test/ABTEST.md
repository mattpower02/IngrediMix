A/B Test Name: Writing or drop down

User Story Number: 2

Metric (from the HEART grid): Happiness

Hypothesis:
As a User I like choosing the ingredients with a drop down menu better than writing it, because it is cleaner than writing it down.

As a project manager I can track this information by seeing what version the user has with similar inputs in the app.  
For example if two users both put in ingredients for hamburgers, the drop down menu would have a longer app usage. 
We will have to track what version of the app certain people have and the amount of time the user was on the app for.



Experiment -  As the product manager I will have 50% of the users have version A while the other half will have version B.  The user will be able to rate how they feel about the change in version A.  We will need to set up the rating system, how long they use the app, and traffic to the last recipe page.


Variations - In Version A would be the normal app where the user would type in the ingredients.  And in Version B would be where the user finds the ingredients on a drop down menu.
