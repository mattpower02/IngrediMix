## IngrediMix 

## Lean Canvas Approach
The Lean Canvas is a strategic management tool that offers a 1-page business plan for startups and businesses. It helps in distilling the fundamental aspects of a business idea into a single, easy-to-understand diagram. To learn more about the Lean Canvas approach, visit [Lean Canvas](https://www.leancanvas.com/).
This approach has helped us define exactly what the problem is, who our customers are, our proposed solution, and how we plan to implement our solution. To add, the lean canvas approach has helped us to think about various revenue streams, and where our product will be in 8 weeks, at the end of this semester.
